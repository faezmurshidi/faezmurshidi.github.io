<p>I assume myself as Jack of all trades -master of none. I’m trying to be good at most of the things rather than being great at one. I love challenges and discovering new thing -and getting out of my comfort zone. <br><br>

I am a graduate from University of Malaya with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (majoring in Computer System and Networking). My university prepares me to become a network engineer -a great one indeed (rank 1st IT faculty in Malaysia). I self-taught Android development from scratch to Google Play Store release, and won 2nd place UM Appstorm Competition -all in the same month which boost my self-confidence that I am a fast-learner -but mostly resourceful. <br><br>

I find anything related to AI, machine learning and data science deeply interesting. For the past few months I have been going deeply in the subject, going from various online courses and material. I am not quite there yet but I’m planning to -that is be really good in this field. <br><br>

If you have any opportunity regarding this field do email me. We might actually help each other out -to get to our goals. I write occasionally on Medium (one of the thing I also want to be good at), helps students with their Android development, and occasionally gives bad advices to aspiring entrepreneur -one of it http://bit.ly/1Pj2HpQ.<br><br>
